PCI/PCI-X Family of Gigabit Ethernet Controllers Software Developer's Manual
82540EP/EM, 82541xx, 82544GC/EI, 82545GM/EM, 82546GB/EB, and 82547xx

These network cards were launched in the 2000s and discontinued in the 2010s, but continue to be a popular choice for virtualization, where they are often referred to as "e1000".

(* Operations:

- receive-related:
  + read RDH: new RDH can be anywhere between old RDH (incl) and RDT (excl),
    we receive the memory chunk for each descriptor between old and new RDH,
    as well as the buffers pointed to by them, which contain newly received packets
  + write RDT: software may set new RDT to anywhere between old RDT (incl) and
    RDH (excl, because otherwise queue considered empty), and by doing so, abandons
    the memory chunks corresponding to these descriptors and the buffers pointed to
    by them, thus providing more space for hardware to store received packets
- transmit-related:
  + read TDH: new TDH can be anywhere between old TDH (incl) and TDT (excl),
    increased TDH means some packets were sent, and we get back the memory chunk
    for each descriptor between old and new TDH, as well as the buffers pointed to
    by them, so we can start reusing these descriptors & buffers for new packets
  + write TDT: software may set new TDT to anywhere between old TDT (incl) and
    TDH (excl, because otherwise queue considered empty), and by doing so, indicates
    that between old and new TDT, there are new packets to be sent, and yields
    the descriptor chunks and the buffers pointed to by them to hardware
