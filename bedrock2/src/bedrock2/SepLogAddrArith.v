Lemma f_equal2: forall {A B: Type} {f1 f2: A -> B} {a1 a2: A},

Proof. intros. congruence. Qed.

   as it wants, but for subterms of type word, applies word solver instead of syntatic unify,

(* Note that "rewr" only works with equalities, not with iff1, so we use

   Alternatively, we could use standard rewrite (which might instantiate too many evars),
   or we could make a "seprewrite" which works on "seps [...] [...]" by replacing the
   i-th clause on any side with the rhs of the provided iff1, or we could make a
   seprewrite which first puts the clause to be replaced as the left-most, and then
   eapplies a "Proper_sep_iff1: Proper (iff1 ==> iff1 ==> iff1) sep", but that would
   change the order of the clauses. *)
