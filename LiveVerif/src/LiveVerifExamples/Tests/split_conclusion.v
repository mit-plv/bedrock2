(* Usually, we keep all adjacent memory in the same sep clause, so when canceling,
   we only need to check if a clause in the hyps is a superrange of the clause
   in the conclusion to be cancelled.
   But in tailrec while lemmas, we get a
   "post-with-small-ghostvars implies post-with-bigger-ghostvars" goal
   and the post-with-small-ghostvars typically has a bigger frame (containing some
   deliberately forgotten memory), which might be adjacent to some non-framed
   memory, but did not get merged together, so during the cancellation to prove
   post-with-bigger-ghostvars, we would need to merge in the hyps, or to split
   in the conclusion, and we chose to split in the conclusion (because currently,
   we never do a search for anything mergeable in the hyps, we only merge back
   stuff that was split before a function call). *)

Example: We're trying to cancel in order 1-2-3, upper line is hyps,
lower line is conclusion.
Note that conclusion clause #1 is not a subrange of any hyp clause,
and no hyp clause is a subrange of a conclusion clause.
But there is a hyp clause whose beginning points into the middle of
conclusion clause 1, so we split the conclusion there, and then continue
as usual by splitting hyps that are a superrange of a conclusion clause.

|--------|-------------|
|--3--|----1--|---2----|

|--------|-------------|
|--3--|1a|-1b-|---2----|

|-----|xx|-------------|
|--3--|xx|-1b-|---2----|


Alternative (would require flexible cancellation order):

|--------|-------------|
|--3--|----1--|---2----|

delay cancellation of 1

|--------|----|xxxxxxxx|
|--3--|----1--|xxxxxxxx|

|xxxxx|--|----|xxxxxxxx|
|xxxxx|----1--|xxxxxxxx|

now we have a hyp clause that's a subrange of the conclusion clause, so split:

|xxxxx|--|----|xxxxxxxx|
|xxxxx|1a|-1b-|xxxxxxxx|


Every boundary at which we might need to split the conclusion is both the beginning
and the end of a range appearing in the hyps, so it's sufficient to only consider
range beginnings in the hyps. *)
